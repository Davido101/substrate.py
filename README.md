## How to use
In the command line, run <code>python3 substrate.py \<filename\></code>. It'll first give you all of the substrate parameters, then all of the cells, then the average nutrient data. To see unknown parameters who have not yet been labeled, use the <code>-d</code> argument. For any findings, questions, and whatnot, message labyrinthsplash on Discord.
